    "# Objectives & Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This report describes the findings from an analysis of sales review data for the major US retail chain, JCPenney. It is the final assignment for the module ITNPBD2 - Representing and Manipulating Data.  This analysis uses five provided datasets, with some supplementary data to augment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report is structured into the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summary\n",
    "- Objectives & Approach\n",
    "- Data Collation, Exploration & Preparation\n",
    "- Data Analysis\n",
    "- Conclusions\n",
    "- References\n",
    "- Appendix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intended primarily as a business report to identify and make recommendations for improvements, with appropriate supporting evidence. In addition, there is a need to meet the additional assignment objectives of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrate that a data science process (here CRISP-DM) has been followed;\n",
    "- Demonstrate the use of Python for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once initial analysis commenced it quickly became evident that two challenges needed to be addressed. The first is that trying to produce a single PDF report with commentary, Python code and runtime output would result in a very long and difficult to read artefact. The second challenge was that a brief examination of the data using Data Wrangler (Microsoft, 2023) quickly revealed that the data was of very poor quality and would make meaningful business conclusions possibly misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the following approach has been taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on the data preparation part of the process and make recommendations on areas to improve\n",
    "- Carry out some limited business analysis, but no significant geographic or demographic aspects\n",
    "- Establish a set of processes that can be reused when better quality source data is available (ie several Jupyter Notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "And in terms of assignment documents, have a two part PDF report:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A largely text report with limited Python code and output\n",
    "- A supporting appendix detailing all Python code and output for the dat preparation stage\n",
    "\n",
    "## CRISP-DM\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to the analysis follows parts two, three and four of the six stage \"CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining' (CRISP-DM) process (Ncr et al., 1999), (Hotz, 2024). In summary, this process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Business Understanding: Define project objectives and requirements by collaborating with stakeholders\n",
    "2. Data Understanding: Collect and explore data, analysing its characteristics and quality\n",
    "3. Data Preparation: Clean, handle missing values, and transform variables to create a structured dataset\n",
    "4. Modelling: Apply various techniques such as machine learning algorithms or statistical models to the prepared data\n",
    "5. Evaluation: Rigorously assess models based on predefined criteria, including performance and reliability\n",
    "6. Deployment: Integrate successful models into existing systems and monitor their effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who Are JCPenney?\n",
    "\n",
    "JCPenney (JCP) is a major North American department store chain ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCPenney)), operating as Penney OpCo LLC. JCP has 656 stores in 49 states plus Puerto Rico according to the [JCP Store Locator](https://www.jcpenney.com/locations/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2020, JCP filed for bankruptcy and were purchased by an asset management company, a large number of stores were also closed. Subsequently, in August 2023, JCP announced a major turnaround plan to replace its current website and inventory management systems, as well as make major upgrades to its retails stores (ModernRetail, 2023). Note that it is assumed that the data used here was extracted from the operational systems prior to any overhaul of information systems.\n"

    "# Data Collation, Exploration & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the sequence and findings of the process of collating the source data, validating and then preparing it for subsequent analysis. Once the preparation processes are all completed the resultant dataframes are persisted locally (using the magic command 'store') making the data available for further analysis. This section focuses on the results of the process and the Appendix details all the Pythin code used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Provided Data Sources & Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided data sources for this analysis of JC Penney consists of two JSON files and three CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- JSON: jcpenney_products, jcpenney_reviewers\n",
    "- CSV: products, reviews, users\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not immediately obvious what the relationships between the two types of data files were but the json and CSV files appear to be partial duplicates of each other; also the three CSV files hold slightly less information (eg sales price is missing from the csv files). The CSV files appear to be a first attempt to extract data from the json files (eg the json products file has a JSON field holding multiple user reviews and this looks like it was extracted to prepare the reviews.csv file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, the approach used in this analysis was to go back to the 'original' JSON files and work from these but with appropriate sanity checks against the three CSV files to make sure no data was missed or inconsistent.\n"

    "The five data sources provided were examined and validated in more detail in order to understand the contents and data structure, and to complete any cleaning required. In addition, areas requiring augmentation were identified and additional data was sourced and combined with the original sources. The resulting working data structure consists of five dataframes, their preparation and content is described in the sections that follow, in the order of their preparation. In summary the five dataframes are:\n",
