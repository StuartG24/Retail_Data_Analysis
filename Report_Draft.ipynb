    "# Objectives & Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This report describes the findings from an analysis of sales review data for a US retail chain, JCPenney. It is the final assignment in the module: ITNPBD2,  Representing and Manipulating Data and uses several datsets provided, with some suplimentary data to augment this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report is structured into four sections:\n",
    "- Summary\n",
    "- Data Collation, Exploration & Preparation\n",
    "- Visualation & Initial Analysis\n",
    "- Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This has primarily been written as a business report, with conclusions and supporting details. However, it also provides details of the analysis approach taken and listings of the Python code used. In order, not to disrupt the flow of the reporting, as much as is possible, the Python code has been put towards the end of report sections **??? or in appendices ??**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was not totally clear about the relative importance of the assignment objectives and so have attempted to meet the objectives stated below, in order of priority:\n",
    "- Provide a business report to senior managers who are not interested in the detailed approach or source data\n",
    "- Demonstrate that a data science process (here CRISP-DM) has been followed\n",
    "- Demonstrate the use of Python for data manipulation and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The original source and timing for the provided datasets is not known and so the following assumptions have been made\n",
    "- Source is from JCP's operational stock and sales systems\n",
    "- The data was extracted in Q3 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "***!! your code must be working, correct, and well commented and shows an appreciation of style, efficiency and reliability. All choices for methods and structures are concisely justified and alternatives are given well thought considerations.***\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRISP-DM\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to the analysis follows the first four parts of the six stage \"CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining' (CRISP-DM) process. ***[!! See citations url and (Ncr et al., 1999) !!]***. In summary, this process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Business Understanding: Define project objectives and requirements by collaborating with stakeholders\n",
    "2. Data Understanding: Collect and explore data, analyzing its characteristics and quality\n",
    "3. Data Preparation: Clean, handle missing values, and transform variables to create a structured dataset\n",
    "4. Modeling: Apply various techniques such as machine learning algorithms or statistical models to the prepared data\n",
    "5. Evaluation: Rigorously assess models based on predefined criteria, including performance and reliability\n",
    "6. Deployment: Integrate successful models into existing systems and monitor their effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who Are JCPenney?\n",
    "\n",
    "JCPenney (JCP) is a major North American department store chain [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCPenney), operating as Penney OpCo LLC. JCP has 656 stores in 49 states plus Puerto Rico according to the [JCP Store Locator](https://www.jcpenney.com/locations/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2020, JCP filed for bankruptcy and were purchased by an asset management company, a large number of stores were also closed. Later, in August 2023, JCP announced a major turnaround plan to replace its current website and inventory management systems, as well as make major upgardes to its retails stores. See this article for more details: [Modern Retail Sep 2023](https://www.modernretail.co/operations/jcpenney-is-the-latest-department-store-to-announce-a-major-turnaround-plan/).\n"

    "- 1. Data Exploration - Explore the data and show you understand its structure and relations\n",
    "- 2. Data Validation - Check the quality of the data. Is it complete? Are there obvious errors?\n",

    "    - Select Data - which to use and which to exclude .. with reasoning\n",
    "    - Clean Data - 'correct, impute, remove' ...\n",
    "    - Construct Data - derive new attributes as needed/helpful\n",

    "- Duplicates - Identify and eliminate duplicates, redundancy. NB: Can occur after data integration\n",

    "It was not immediately obvious what the relationships between the two types of data were but the json and CSV files appear to be partial duplicates of each other; also the three CSV files hold slightly less information (eg sales price is missing from the csv files).

Further analysis found that 15,535 (40%) of reviews were used by several customers, worst case being several instances of 18 customers using the same comments. This could be because the sample data has been automaticaly generated or that customer ids are being created to generate false reviews. This data has not been dropped from the dataset, although later sentiment analysis of the reviews could be misleading.\n",
